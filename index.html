                  Legend has it that Robert Johnson sold his soul to the Devil in oder to become a legend of Blues. Robert Johnson's
                life was not an easy one.<br><br>
              Johnson's fisrt wife died when giving birth to their first child.<br> Her parents, filed with grief, blamed Johnson for her death claiming it is because <br>
              he played the devil's music.<br> Later on in his life Johnson had another child with a woman,<br> this time however, her parents
          refused for him to see the child or his mother.<br> Yet again his passion for the blues was seen as an act of siding with the devil.</p>
